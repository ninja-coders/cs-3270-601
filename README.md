## CLASS SCHEDULE

A detailed schedule for the class can be found on the courses [canvas page](https://uvu.instructure.com/courses/453130).   

### Weekly Overview

So the below schedule is broken out into 16 parts that should correspond to the 16 weeks that class is held, however
some of the weeks will be shorter than others (given tests, vacataion days, etc). So there is likely going to be
overlap between weeks on content.

16. Python Science (numpy, scikit) and C Integration (book 12 pg. 335-338, 373-385)

## READING MATERIAL

The official book for the course is [Introducing Python by Lubanovic](https://www.amazon.com/Introducing-Python-Modern-Computing-Packages/dp/1449359361).     

## OBJECTIVES

By the end of the semester you will be able to confidently complete applications developed
using the python programming language, following python best practicies and idioms.   

## PHILOSOPHY

Computer Science is an ever evolving discipline.  As such there is an expectation that students
who are involved in this course will put forth their effort to personally increase their knowledge
while in class, as well as out of class.   

There will also be a large amount of effort that is
placed on following Software Engineering principles that are used in the field in hopes of 
acclimatizing you to more professional development.    

Finally since we are all attending a University there will be a requirement that all of your
interactions with professors, TA's and students will be done with respect.   

Above all, have fun!  Python is a great language that is a lot of fun to work with and I 
hope that by the end of the semester you may all feel the same.    

## STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES 

If you have any disability that may impair your ability to successfully complete this course,
please contact the UVU Accessibility Services Department (LC 312, www.uvu.edu/asd/; 863-8747).
Academic accommodations are granted for all students who have qualified documented disabilities.
Services are coordinated with the student and instructor by the Accessibility Services Department.    

## GRADING

Grades will be based on the following: (**Note: this is possibly subject to adjustment during the semester**)    

* Programming Assignments: 70%   
* Exams: 30%   
* In-class Quizzes: __Extra Credit__   

**Note: Since quizzes are only given in class, they can not be made up**    

### Grading Scale

|      +       |               |       -      |
| ------------ | ------------- | ------------ |
|              | A  93% - 100% | A- 90% - 92% |
| B+ 87% - 89% | B  83% - 86%  | B- 80% - 82% |
| C+ 77% - 79% | C  73% - 76%  | C- 70% - 72% |
| D+ 67% - 69% | D  63% - 66%  | D- 60% - 62% |
| F  59% less  |               |              |

## PROGRAMMING ASSIGNMENTS

As you can imagine, a programming language course will have programming assignments, and these
assignments are (by far) the most important aspect of the class.  This is because to be a good
developer takes practice, not memorization.   

For all the code that you submit you will need to make sure that the python you write follows the
[Google python style guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html).  Also we will be 
using [Github](https://www.github.com) as our tool for both getting assignments and submitting
your code.  

A more detailed description of what is needed is defined in `SUBMISSIONS.md`    

**Note: If you need a tutorial on git use [GitImmersion](http://gitimmersion.com/)**    

### Late Policy

There will be a 10% penalty per calendar day late (this includes weekends). After 5 days you will not
receive any credit for the assignment.  

### Plagarism

In this class you will need to have your own code typed out, not copied from someone else.  This does
not mean that you are not able to work with each other to complete a project, only that you will be
responsible for your own assignments and for understanding the content yourself.  

### Development System

I am not sure what version of python the labs have installed, but likely it is not the most recent
version.  As such you will be expected to find a way to run the most recent version, whether on your
own machine or using a cloud based machine (like AWS or Azure).   

Also python in general is setup to work on any OS, but you will need to make sure that the solution
you submit will work on linux system as this is the system I will be grading on.  This basically means
don't hard code directories or values that are going to be windows or mac specific (or even linux
since you could be using a different distro).    

## EXAMS

In this class there will be a midterm and a final exam.  I am planning to get both of these tests
submitted to the testing center so that they will be available for a period of time, however if that
is unable to be accomplished we will take the test during a class period.   

Exams will be over any of the material that is either discussed in class, should have been used when
completing a programming assignment, or over supplied reading material.   

Final exam schedule can be found [on UVU's website, here](https://www.uvu.edu/asc/exam_schedule.html)    

**Note: If the final exam is given in class, it will only be given during the scheduled day, no makeup**    

## QUIZZES

There will be quizzes in this class which will be for extra credit only, so there is no reason to take
quiz and no penalty to your final grade by missing them.  As such **there is no makeup for missed quizzes**.   

Quizzes themselves will mostly be unannounced and have the potential to cover any material either discussed,
or even implied, in the course.  The main purpose is to spark discussions or even give you new topics 
to research on your own outside of class.
