    "\n",
    "For this assignment there are going to be two parts. \n",
    "1. The ability to navigate a file using commands (u, d, t, b, #, q). \n",
    "2. A GUI that is created to support these operations (using tkinter). \n",
    "\n",
    "## Part 1\n",
    "\n",
    "- Write a file viewing function:  \n",
    "\n",
    "        def view(fname, view_size=25): ...\n",
    "        \n",
    "Now while this function is the main execution point for the cli code, the vast majority of the\n",
    "code for interacting with the file should exist in a more module fashion, and example would be\n",
    "to create a `FileView` class that contains the logic behind the actual file naviation, but\n",
    "allows for the driver to be seperate.  This is important as the logic you create to navigate\n",
    "the file will be re-used in __Part 2__.   \n",
    "        \n",
    "an example of a class interface that you could create would be something like the following:  \n",
    "\n",
    "        class FileView:\n",
    "            def __init__(self, fname, view_size): ...\n",
    "            def next_page(self, direction): ....\n",

    "            def select_bottom_page(self): ...\n",
    "                    \n",
    "For this first part, we are going to be running inside a simple console application. This\n",
    "application will allow a user to navigate a file using the keyboard. \n",
    "\n",
    "Store this function and code that launches it as a main program in a module named\n",
    "`view.py`. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Note: You will not be storing the entire text of this file in memory–you will be rereading\n",
    "portions of the file to display the appropriate text on demand.**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Steps \n",
    "\n",
    "First, traverse the requested file to determine the file positions where each “page” (screen)\n",
    "of view_size lines begins (in other words, read view_size lines, then record the file\n",
    "position, then repeat this process until you’ve passed through the entire file once; record\n",
    "file positions by calling file.tell). \n",
    "\n",
    "After you have read in the page sections you will then display the first page, and give the \n",
    "user the following prompt: \n",
    "\n",
    "        Command [u,d,t,b,#,q]:\n",
    "        \n",
    "The commands are interpreted as follows:   \n",
    "- `u` move up one page; if already at the top, wrap to the last page\n",
    "- `d` move down one page; if at the bottom, wrap to the first page\n",
    "- `t` move to the top (first) page\n",
    "- `b` move to the bottom (last) page\n",
    "- (number) moves to page number (1-based)\n",
    "- `q` quit\n",
    "\n",
    "If the user just hits the Enter key, consider that a “down” command.  \n",
    "If the user enters a number, move to that page/screen. If the number is out of range, move to the \n",
    "top or bottom as appropriate. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Note: Of course you will use file.seek to move from page to page.**   \n",
    "\n",
    "### Startup\n",
    "\n",
    "Obtain the file name from the command line where view.py is the top-level module. In\n",
    "addition, process an optional, second command-line argument that represents the desired\n",
    "screen display size (which defaults to 25, as shown above).  \n",
    "\n",
    "For example,  \n",
    "\n",
    "        $ python view.py yankee.txt 20\n",
    "        \n",
    "This allows viewing the text in the file yankee.txt 20 lines at a time. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Note: Use the file yankee.txt, found in `hw6`. A sample user session is also provided.**  \n",
