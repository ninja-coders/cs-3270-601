Strings


Like many of the generation of "seasoned" programmers, my career in coding began with 
number crunching. Most of the time my FORTRAN programs just emitted numbers 
accompanied by terse labels. As I stood in line at the university computing center to 
submit my deck of punched cards to the IBM OS/360 expediters (as they were called), I 
would feel sorry for the COBOL programmers who hefted decks 10-20 times the size of 
mine. "The poor things", I would mutter to myself. "Their hundreds of cards only print a 
silly report while my less-than-one-inch deck solves a system of differential equations. I 
hope I never have to learn that stupid language!" I didn't. But when it came time to report 
my findings in a more formal way, I had to get out a typewriter.

Don't get me wrong. I'm pleased and proud to never have written a single line of 
COBOL, but FORTRAN IV's string handling capabilities were nothing to write home 
about, manually or electronically. No string data type, no dynamic memory allocation, no 
string nothing.  When I left school to embark on a career as a "scientific programmer", I 
found that business required at least as much text and data processing than mathematics, 
and found myself wanting a more suitable programming language. And if you want the 
whole truth, let me admit that most of the projects at my first job used COBOL for I/O.

Back to BASIC's

When once I needed to do some sophisticated string manipulation, someone suggested I 
use SNOBOL. "Sure, why not? It's just another programming language", I thought. Ha! I 
just wasn't ready for such a weird syntax. Then I remembered having run across BASIC 
in one of my college classes. Like most "real programmers", I had dismissed it as a toy, 
but boy, I certainly could have used a + operator for concatenation or a MID$() for 
searching right about then! But BASIC wasn't available in our environment, and besides, 
C was becoming the language of choice almost everywhere, so I quickly learned the joys 
of null-terminated arrays of char. And malloc(). And realloc(). And memory 
leaks.

So here we are programming in Internet Time and have now, with C++ and Java, come 
full circle to what BASIC provided originally: strings that manage their own memory. 
What took so long? I wish I knew.

Java provides two string classes: String and StringBuffer. Both are defined in the 
package java.lang, and both represent sequences of char (a 16-bit Unicode character). 
The key difference between the two classes is that String objects are immutable, and 
hence can be easily pooled and shared. Whenever you use a string literal (characters 
between pairs of double quotes), the Java Virtual Machine checks first to see if it has 
appeared previously. If not, it stores it in the string pool, and returns a reference to it. The 
next time you use that literal, the JVM just gives you its reference back, so all 
occurrences of a particular string literal refer to a single String instance. You can even 
request a reference for a string built at runtime, as the program in Figure 1 illustrates. The 
variable s2 refers to the same object as s1, since the compiler can determine at compile 
time that the character sequences are the same. A new object is explicitly created for s3, 
so the references are distinct. (Let this be a lesson on how not to create strings from 
literals - if there is no need for a distinct object, don't use new). s4 is also a unique 
object since its value is determined at runtime. To force a runtime check into the string 
pool, use intern(), as I did for s5.

The String class comes with the usual methods for searching and extracting substrings, 
changing case (for locales where case applies), and converting strings to numbers. Here's 
a grep-like program that extracts lines from a text file that contain a given string:

import java.io.*;

class Search
{
    public static void main(String[] args)
        throws IOException
    {
        // Read Standard Input:
        BufferedReader in =
            new BufferedReader(
                new InputStreamReader(System.in));

        // Process each line:
        String line;
        while ((line = in.readLine()) != null)
            if (line.indexOf(args[0]) >= 0)
                System.out.println(line);
    }
}

The indexOf method returns the 0-based index where its argument appears in its string, 
or returns -1 if it's not there. Like many of String's methods, there is also version of 
indexOf that specifies the search start position as well (i.e., indexOf(String str, 
int fromIndex)), so you can find multiple instances within a single line. There is also 
a lastIndexOf method for searching from the right, and startsWith and endsWith 
methods, which are special cases of the indexOf and lastIndexOf, respectively.

Executing Search.java on its own source searching for the string "read" gives the 
following output:

while ((line = in.readLine()) != null)

That's because indexOf is case-sensitive, as you would expect, so the lines that contain 
the substring "Read" don't qualify. To extract lines without regard to case, I'll have to 
convert both the search string and each line to the same case (see Figure 2). Although 
there is an equalsIgnoreCase method in the String class, that won't help here since 
it compares entire strings and I'm looking for a substring. This time the output is as 
follows:

C:> java Search2 read <Search.java
        BufferedReader in =
            new BufferedReader(
                new InputStreamReader(System.in));
        while ((line = in.readLine()) != null)

The program in Figure 3 reads standard input and uses indexOf and the substring 
method to replace all occurrences of the string in args[0] with the string in args[1]. 
The output in Figure 3 comes from the following command line:

C:> java Replace in $$$ <Replace.java 

Both String and StringBuffer are thread-safe: String because its instances are 
immutable, and StringBuffer because its mutator methods are synchronized (hence 
String is more efficient from a thread overhead point of view). While most of the time 
String does the job, StringBuffer is more efficient if you need to append to a string 
repeatedly. In fact StringBuffer is used internally whenever you use the + 
concatenation operator with instances of String. The expression a + b + c, for 
example is equivalent to the following expression:

new StringBuffer(a).append(b).append(c).toString();

Using StringBuffer instead of String can sometimes bring noticeable gains in 
efficiency. To see this, replace the body of the inner while loop in Figure 3 with the 
following:

            {
                StringBuffer temp = new StringBuffer(newLine);
                newLine = temp.replace(pos2, pos2 + fromLen,
                                       args[1]).toString();
                pos1 = pos2 + toLen;
            }

Running javap -c Replace (the byte-code disassembler) both before and after the 
change reveals that the StringBuffer version generates 11 fewer byte code 
instructions. StringBuffer.replace works within a single buffer, allocating 
memory only when necessary. Since the creation of the substrings is not needed in the 
second version, the code is more efficient. For further optimization, if you know the 
largest a StringBuffer will ever need to grow, you can allocate it once and for all 
with the method StringBuffer.ensureCapacity(int minimumCapacity). 
The loop above would be even simpler if StringBuffer had an indexOf operator, 
since it could just declare newLine as a StringBuffer and do without temp 
altogether. Too bad the Java library folks didn't include it.

The program in Figure 4 illustrates the method String.charAt in determining 
whether a string is a palindrome (i.e., whether it reads the same backward as it does 
forward). If String had a reverse method, like StringBuffer does, you might be 
tempted to use it to just compare a string to its reversal, but that would be much less 
efficient than using Palindrome.isSymmetric.

Palindromes are more interesting and readable if they can have whitespace and 
punctuation, which you then ignore when testing for symmetry (such strings are called 
imperfect palindromes). The program in Figure 5 does just that by using 
StringBuffer.deleteCharAt in Palindrome2.normalize to strip out non-
letters (via Character.isLetter) before calling isSymmetric. It also changes 
each character to lower case so the comparison will be case-insensitive. The logic is a 
little tricky: notice that the variable i is incremented only if the character is not deleted. 
Since the length of the string can change, I have to call s.length() explicitly every 
time the loop iterates, instead of caching it like I did in Figure 4. And once again, I have 
to traverse the string one character at a time searching for non-letters since 
StringBuffer does not have an indexOf method.

Tokenizing

Much of the time a program that processes text needs to extract tokens. Java provides a 
class in the java.util package, StringTokenizer for this purpose. In its simplest 
application, a StringTokenizer object extracts tokens delimited by white space from 
a string. The program in Figure 6 places up to 256 space-delimited tokens from the file 
tokens.dat in Figure 7 into an array, converts them to lower case, and sorts them with 
the Arrays.sort algorithm. (I'll say more about java.util.Arrays next month). After 
initializing a StringTokenizer with the string to parse, the hasMoreTokens 
method will return true if there are any tokens left to extract, and nextToken will 
return the next one as a String. You can call StringTokenizer.countTokens 
at any time if you want to know how many tokens are left without advancing the 
tokenization position.

White-space-only delimiters are not useful very often, however. The output in Figure 6, 
for example, contains unwanted punctuation. To extract only alphanumeric tokens, you 
can give a StringTokenizer an optional string representing the delimiters to ignore 
during tokenization, as I did with the string delims in Figure 8. This behaves pretty 
much the same as strtok() from the standard C library, except that the string is not 
altered in the process. And like strtok(), nextToken can take an optional string 
argument so you can change the set of delimiters with each call.

Yet another usage of StringTokenizer extracts the delimiters themselves, one 
character at a time. In Figure 9, I give the StringTokenizer constructor a third 
argument of true, which tells the object that I only want the delimiters back. I use this 
behavior to count the number of vowels in the input file.

Summary

Java's string classes provide most of what you need for everyday text processing: 
substring searching and construction, case conversion, and basic token parsing. I hope 
you managed to pick up on a bit of irony in this article, however. I began by talking about 
number crunching, yet I've carefully avoided talking about formatting numeric I/O. 
There's a good reason, which you'll see next month when I explain locales and Java's 
formatting classes. (Yes formatting is in separate classes, not in format strings!)
