Assignment Submissions
================================================

For this class all assignments will be submitted by pushing code to a remote hosted on github for which
i have been granted access to.  The details on how you will need to setup your repository and how I will
retrieve the code for testing is defined below.   

## Git

For this course we will be using the git source control system.  Git provides the ability to be able to
synchronize all of your code and associated history.  There are a few important keywords that will be
used through out this document, they are defined below.   

* remote - A remote is a reference to an external git repo that you can sync your code with    
* upstream - the remote that should be considered the source of most changes.   
* origin - the default remote that git will push/pull from   
* pull - Synchronizing your local git repo with a remote's repo by retrieving all deltas from remote to local   
* push - Synchronizing remote repo with your local git repo by sending your deltas up to a remote   
* github - A hosted git management tool for working with remote repo.   
* commit - Capture all the current changes into a single delta and point current branch at the new delta    
* branch - A local pointer to the list of deltas to be using with your code.   
* master - The default branch that git repos use.    

## Commands

* `git clone <url>` - Downloads the git repository for specified location to your local hard drive   
* `git add <file>` - Takes the supplied file and tells git to add the changes to the next delta   
* `git commit -m <msg>` - Take the requested deltas and creates the commit    
* `git pull <remote> <branch>` - Pull the remote branch to your current local branch   
* `git push <remote> <branch>` - Push the current list of deltas to given remote.   
* `git remote add <remote> <url>` - Adds a new remote to the list of remotes   

## Initial Assignment Repo Steps

To work with the assignments for this course you will need to accomplish the below steps.   

1. Obtain github account with private access   
2. Create a new `private` repo named `<uvuid>-assignments` (do not select Initialize README or select anything from the dropdowns)   
3. Add the user `mikekwright` as a collaborator to the repo   
4. Email me the created repo to the address `mkwright+uvu@gmail.com`   
5. Clone the repo to your local machine.   `git clone <your url>`   
6. Navigate to the repo directory.  `cd <uvuid>-assignments`   
7. Add this repo as the classes upstream repo `git remote add upstream https://github.com/ninja-coders/cs-3270-601 or git@github.com:ninja-coders/cs-3270-601.git`   
8. Pull down the upstream remote to your local system.  `git pull upstream master`   
9. Add a file to the root of the repo named `student` fill that file with contents of `Your Name` and `UVUID`    
10. Add the new file to staged `git add student`
11. Commit the new file `git commit -m "Added student file"`   
12. Push the repo with commits to your github repo `git push origin master`   
13. Navigate to the repo in the browser of your choice and make sure it is visible
14. Install the class python dependencies (this assumes you have python already installed) **NOTE: your pip may be called pip3 or pip3.6**

    pip install -r requirements.txt

15. Test out access to jupyter by running the below command

    jupyter notebook

16. Open browser to [localhost:8888](localhost:8888) if browser is not automatically opened for you.

## Each Assignment

For every assignment that you are given in the class you will be required to create a pull request that can be used to apply comments and
overall grading notes.  The flow for each assignment is below.  

1. Make sure you are on your master branch `git checkout master`
2. Pull all changes from the upstream repo `git pull upstream master`
3. Checkout a new branch for the assignment `git checkout -b assignment-<assignment number>`
4. Complete the assignment
5. Stage the appropriate files for the assignment `git add <file>`
6. Commit the completed assignment `git commit -m "<A message about completing the assignment"`
7. Push the changes to your branch `git push origin assignment-<assignment number>`
8. Create a pull request [https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/).
9. Submit the pull request url
10. Once graded merge the pull request to your master branch
11. Pull the latest changes `git pull origin master`
